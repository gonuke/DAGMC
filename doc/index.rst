What is DAGMC?
==============

The Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) toolkit enables the direct
use of CAD-based geometries in Monte Carlo radiation transport problems.  This
is increasingly valuable as analysts seek to understand the radiation fields
in complex geometries, and especially when the details of those geometries are
important.

The DAGMC toolkit is implemented as a component of the Mesh-Oriented datABase
[MOAB_], providing fundamental functions for the ray-tracing and related
geometry operations of Monte Carlo radiation transport directly on complex 3-D
geometries such as those created in modern solid modeling software.

DAGMC is designed in a modular fashion with the expectation that it
can be integrated into a variety of Monte Carlo radiation tools. The
CNERG_ group at UW-Madison has historically focussed development on the
MCNP5_ software developed at `Los Alamos National Laboratory
<http://www.lanl.gov>`_ and distributed by the `Radiation Safety
Information Computing Center <http://rsicc.ornl.gov>`_. However, recently
DAGMC has been integrated into the following Monte Carlo physics packages
: MCNP5_, Tripoli4_, Fluka_, Geant4_, and Shift_.

We have prior experience integrating DAGMC with MCNP/X, and planned
efforts to integrate DAGMC with other Monte Carlo physics packages
including: MCNP6_, Serpent2_, Phits_, OpenMC_ and Frensie.

While there is no omplete GUI, we currently rely on the Cubit_
software from Sandia and its commercial counterpart, Trelis_.  
It plays a role in our workflow that can
include importing CAD-files from other tools such as SolidWorks,
CATIA, etc.  In addition to defining the geometry, we rely on
Cubit/Trelis for material assignment and can also support some other aspects
of input definition that are tied to the geometry (tallies and
variance reduction parameters, for example).  Some knowledge of the 
specific Monte Carlo application is necessary for other 
parameters such as material definition, run control and source definition.

MOAB_ is developed by a team of collaborators at
Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison (UW), who are also working on improving some of 
the GUI tools available for manipulating workflows.
